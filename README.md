# PySnake Game üéÆ
‚ÄúA classic Snake Game mini project built using Python and Pygame with sound effects and scoring.‚Äù

## Aim
To design and develop a Snake Game using Python (Pygame) and OOP principles.

## Description
A simple and interactive Snake Game built using the Pygame library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food while avoiding collisions with the wall or its own tail. Sound effects and score tracking are included.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Features
- Dynamic snake movement  
- Sound effects for eating and wall collision  
- Real-time score display  
- Random food placement

  # Problems Faced
 - Difficulty in setting the correct cell size and number of cells to make the snake reach the screen edges properly.
 -Images and sound files (food.png, food_eat.mp3, wall_hit.mp3) were not loading because of incorrect file paths.
-The grid size and cell alignment had to be recalculated to make sure the snake reaches the border.
-Initially, collisions with walls and self-tail were not working correctly due to logic placement in update loop.
-The score variable was not incrementing properly after eating food.
 -Encountered delays in playing sound effects due to multiple overlapping pygame.mixer calls.
- Difficulty in github installation and setup.
